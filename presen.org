In this work, we generalized the proposed method by detecting and
categorizing the logical structure which forms each loop.
For example, programs do not know that cars consists of several parts such as doors, engines and tires.

** Example: Percolation in 2-dimentional grids

 A node is either *occupied* or *unoccupied*

** Phase Transition

** Macros may be shifting the ratio to the right

 [[png:percolate/cluster5]]

** Forward Search : Increasing /r/ as the search progresses

 [[png:percolate/cluster6]]

** Open Questions

 + *Prove the connection between macro-operators and critical value*
   + I am testing if randomly generated *Junk Macros* improve the performance
     + *Ongoing work --- /positive results/ (next slide)*
 + *How /existing macro-approaches/ change the connectivity?*
   + MacroFF(Botea05), Marvin(Coles04,07) MUM(Chrpa14), CAP(Asai15), BLOMA(Siddiqui15)
 + *What is the /r_c/ of each domain?*
   + critical value of Logistics is X, Barman is Y ...
 + *At which /r/ does each search algorithm find a solution?*
   + Lookahead search, GBFS, Type-GBFS, A*, Random Walk...

** Meta-parameter which defines the shape: Fractal dimension

 a statistical index of complexity comparing how detail in a pattern changes with the scale at which it is measured

*** Computing the Fractal Dimension





*** Connections between Fractals and Search Algorithms

** Possible Benefits:

 + More thoeries about macro operators. Only thing we know:
   + "*Increases branching factor*"
   + *!=* *effective* branching factor by heuristic search
 + Understand Search Algorithms by the *shape of the explored space*
   + What is the fundamental difference between 2 algorithms?
** Effective Search Space

 Search space evaluated by the search algorithm ⊆ (entire) search space

 [[png:fractals/ess]]

 Each search algorithm defines its */shape/*

** Inherent Danger of Showing Research Ideas at DC                 :noexport:
 
 I am inclined to continuing research after graduation as a PostDoc / maybe in industry, but showing too much
 unreliable ideas here may cause this:

 #+BEGIN_ALIGNRIGHT
 (just be sure, I'm *not* claiming I am Einstein, no!)
 #+END_ALIGNRIGHT

 # + Do you want to hire people with crazy ideas? or
 # + Do you want to hire people with safe ideas?
 # + Depending on the answers, I should not show some part of the slides in this talk
